<h1>Hello there, and welcome to my wonderful website!</h1>

<p style="color:white">
This website will eventually have something here. Hopefully I'll be able to make a good blog over on another page!<br />
I'm probably just gonna ramble over there. Pretty much I've just got this for the fancy Email, but the website was <br />
free, so I can't complain! 
</p>

<p style="color:white">
I'm pretty shit at website design really, so this will look really bad! However I hope that the content would be interesting.<br />
